JIRA software is a tool Clearsense uses to plan, track, and manage our agile software development work for our products/products. 


JIRA Projects are created by Clearsense teams for not only one-time project work for product/software development, but also for products that will continue to have feature enhancements added over time, change management requests, customer support requests and more.   Each project can have it's own customized workflow, and as part of the Atlassian suite, integrates with our other tools like Bitbucket, Bamboo, SonarQube, and Confluence.   Work is tracked by JIRA issues/tickets, which can be in the form of user stories, tasks, bugs, sub-tasks, and more.   In order for development work to be done, it must be associated with a JIRA ticket for planning and traceability.  This is instilled as part of the definition of done for a user story.

Key features of JIRA software:

Plan
Create user stories and issues, plan sprints, and distribute tasks across your software team.

Track
Prioritize and discuss your teamâ€™s work in full context with complete visibility.

Release
Ship with confidence and sanity knowing the information you have is always up-to-date.

Report
Improve team performance based on real-time, visual data that your team can put to use.



JIRA also integrates with hundreds of developer tools, and can also be enhanced by over 3000 apps available within the Atlassian Marketplace.
