| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| git status   | git status     | git status    |
| git diff     | git diff       | git diff      |

You can create fenced code blocks by placing triple backticks (```)before and after the code block. We recommend placing a blank line before and after code blocks to make the raw formatting easier to read.

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
Here is a simple flow chart:

To create a Mermaid diagram, add Mermaid syntax inside a fenced code block with the mermaid language identifier. 
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
You can use geo/topoJSON syntax to create interactive maps. **To create a map**, add **geoJSON / topoJSON** inside a fenced code block with the geojson or topojson syntax identifier. 



```geojson
{
  "type": "Polygon",
  "coordinates": [ 
      [
          [-90,30],
          [-90,35],
          [-90,35],
          [-85,35],
          [-85,30]
      ]
  ]
}
```
**Insert /upload/drag and drop an image** - create a new issue, drag and drop the image and copy the source code and include the code in the markdown file. To upload multiple images ata time, select as bundle.
